## 📂 What's Inside?

This repository covers the end-to-end process of building applications with LLMs, from data handling to creating advanced conversational agents.

-   🏗️ **LLM Foundations**
    -   Data Ingestion & Transformation (`RecursiveJsonSplitter`)
    -   Text Embeddings with Hugging Face

-   💾 **Vector Stores & Retrieval**
    -   Working with Vector Databases like **ChromaDB** & **AstraDB**
    -   Advanced Retrieval with **Hybrid Search** (e.g., BM25)

-   🛠️ **Building with LLMs & LangChain**
    -   Core concepts using **LangChain** & LangChain Expression Language (**LCEL**)
    -   Integrating with LLM providers: **OpenAI**, **Hugging Face**, and local models with **Ollama**
    -   Developing user interfaces with **Streamlit** & **Gradio**

-   🤖 **Applications & Projects**
    -   Basic & Conversational Q&A Chatbots
    -   PDF Querying Systems
